  <h1>Configuration Guide</h1>    
  
  <strong>Format</strong>
  <p>The configuration is read from <b class="path">app/code/local/Elite/Vaf/config.ini</b>. We use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">ini configuration format</a>.</p>
  
  <strong>Default Configuration</strong>
  <p>A default file is located in Vaf/config.default.ini - you should copy this file &amp; rename to config.ini, and edit the settings as you desire.
  Where possible, a comment (prefixed with a semicolon ';') will appear describing a setting, within the config.ini. For a full description of a setting, please refer to this extended configuration guide.</p>
    
<h2 id="category">Catalog Categories</h2> 
<h4>[Category]</h4> 
<div id="category">    
    <i>Controls how the extension modifies your category pages. Also see related settings homepagesearch/exclude_categories and categorychooser/ignore which are settings that control behavior related to categories on other store pages.</i>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>disable</b> -  Disable filtering on all category pages.

            <p> This is if you want the vehicle search to "be seperate" from your main store, for "window shopping" style. If disable is set to true, the extension will provide the make/model/year search form and filter on all category pages by default, unless white/black listing is in effect.</p>
            <p>Example usage: disable = true</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>mode</b> - Change the category mode for when user clicks through to a category page.
            <p>Defaults to "default". Alternatively specify "group" for 'group view' on every category page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>whitelist</b> -  Allows you to control for which categories filtering is enabled. Should be a comma separated list of category IDs.
            <br />
            <b>blacklist</b> -  Allows you to control for which categories filtering is disabled. Should be a comma separated list of category IDs.
            <br />
            For instance if only one of your categories is applicable to the make/model/year search. Works according to these rules:
            <ul>
                <li>If whitelisting is specified, and the customer is on the category specified, the they will see the filter.</li>
                <li>If blacklist is specified, and the customer is on the category specified, the they will not see the filter.</li>
                <li>If neither is specified, the value of "disabled" will control wether the customer will see the filter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example Usage:<br />
            whitelist = "4,3,2"; only enable the search on this category<br />
            blacklist = "1,2,3"   ; do not enable the search on this category
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>requireVehicle</b> - Allows you to require user to select a vehicle before seeing products. Should be a comma separated list of category IDs. Optionally set to "all" to match all category IDs.
            <br />
            Example Usage:
            <br />
            requireVehicle = "1,2,3"
            <br />
            requireVehicle = "all"
            <br />
